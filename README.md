# Libft
> *Your very first own library*

*C programming can be very tedious when one doesn’t have access to the highly useful standard functions.*
*This project is about understanding the way these functions work, implementing and learning to use them.*
*Your will create your own library. It will be helpful since you will use it in your next C school assignments.*
*Take the time to expand your libft throughout the year.*
*However, when working on a new project, don’t forget to ensure the functions used in your library are allowed in the project guidelines.*

## Table of Contents
*This project is about coding a C library. It will contain a lot of general purpose functions your programs will rely upon.*
